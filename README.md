# 📣 Subitobot 📣
[![Docker](https://github.com/Sasso0101/subitobot/actions/workflows/docker-publish.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/Sasso0101/subitobot/actions/workflows/docker-publish.yml)

Subitobot is a Telegram bot designed to notify a user about new listings posted on [subito.it](https://www.subito.it).

The bot is distributed as a Docker image, which is published on [Github packages](https://github.com/Sasso0101/subitobot/pkgs/container/subitobot).

### Installation
Download the `docker-compose.yaml` file from the repository:
```
mkdir subitobot
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sasso0101/subitobot/master/docker-compose.yaml
```
Edit the `data/config.toml` file located in the project's directory with your telegram user id (you can obtain it using [myidbot](https://t.me/myidbot)) and the bot token generated by [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).

Configure the list of tracked items in the `config.toml` file. Check the file for examples of use. All fields are optional except for `keyword`.
#### Description of the fields
- `keyword` (string): name of the item
- `region` (array of integers): restrict the search to specific regions. The regions must be encoded using [these codes](docs/regions.md). Arrays are specified as follows: `[x, y, z]`.
- `province` (integer): restrict the search to a province. The province must be encoded using [these codes](docs/provinces.md). When used `region` must be specified too.
- `city` (integer): restrict the search to a city. The city must be encoded using its ISTAT code (a list can be found [here](https://dait.interno.gov.it/territorio-e-autonomie-locali/sut/elenco_codici_comuni.php)).
- `category` (integer): restrict the search to a category. The category must be encoded using [these codes](docs/categories.md).
- `search_only_title` (boolean): restrict the search to the title of the postings only. `false` by default.

Run the following commands:
```
mkdir data
docker compose up
```
Start the container! 🚀
```
docker start subitobot
```

The Docker container will check if new listings have been posted, send the notifications and quit. If you want to check periodically for new listings you can use `cron` or similar tools to run the container on a schedule.

### Build from source
Clone the repository and run:
```
docker build -t subitobot .
```
